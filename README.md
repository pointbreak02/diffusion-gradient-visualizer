This is a simple simulation of 2D diffusion using Python and NumPy.

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

## 🧠 What's happening?

A high concentration is placed in the center of a grid and allowed to diffuse outward, visualizing the concept of passive diffusion.
